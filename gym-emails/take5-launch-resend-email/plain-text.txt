Gymnasium - Bridging the gap between education and opportunity.

ICYMI: We launched Take 5 tutorials - free videos that cover practical skills in just 5 minutes.

To kick things off, we've dropped a new video every day with a new theme each week. So far we've released 10+ videos on CSS and prototyping.

Next up:

- Career Skills (like storytelling and self-promotion)
- User Research (from card sorting to writing survey questions)

Trust us - you do not want to miss this.
