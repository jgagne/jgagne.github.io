Gymnasium - Bridging the gap between education and opportunity.

A Decade of Responsive Web Design

Join us on Tuesday, May 26, at 2 p.m. EDT for a webinar with Ethan Marcotte — the fellow who started that whole "responsive design" thing.

Let's celebrate the past decade of his groundbreaking work, its impact, and the future of responsive web design.

We'll discuss topics like:

- How the web industry has evolved over the course of the past decade

- How to decode the blurred lines that exist between native and web apps

- How designers should be thinking about inclusivity and accessibility
